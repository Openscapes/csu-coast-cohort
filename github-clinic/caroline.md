Have you noticed the `[]()` pattern to make links in Markdown? Put words to hyperlink in `[]` and the URL in `()`. 
Testing another hyperlink: [https://mlml.sjsu.edu/] vs (https://mlml.sjsu.edu/)

We can include an image with the same format, but note the preceding exclamation point: `![]()` *(From the browser, you'll need an image with an existing url).*
